## It's Boids
A boids game inspired by the artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986. The program is object oriented and uses inheritance for the three classes. Sprites and vectors have been used. Reynolds three rules are implemented and tuned so that the flocks move in a life like way. There are three birdcages that work as obstacles for the boids. There is a hoik appearing on screen that scares the boids away. It appears when the mouse is clicked.

Requires Python3 and Pygame installed.

Make sure to have all the files in the zip folder in the same directory when you run the program.

To run the program write python3 itsBoids.pyin the terminal.

Click the mouse in the game window to spawn the hoik.
